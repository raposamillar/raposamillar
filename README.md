### Hi 👋🏼 <em>Bonjour</em>
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UX/UI Design (and loving it!)
- 🔭 I'm also working on two projects: 
        1) a webpage of local routes used by my running group 👟
        2) a database of musical compositions 🎼
- ⚡ Fun fact: J'ai enseigné le piano en français pendant deux ans
